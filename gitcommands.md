after creating the document

git init

(add doc for tracking, one time only command)

git status

git add <file name>

git commit -m "message"

git status
(should tell you working branch clean)

git log
(tells you all the changes)

note: use "ls -a" to see if a folder has a .git repository, if it does then changes are tracked in git
(hidden because if you accidentally delete it you'll remove all your version control)
